Overview.
You spawn inside a 512x512 terrain. The goal of the game is to walk arround and shoot a variety of spawning
dummys. Once shooting, the dummys will fly around. Their bodys will contor with the placement of the associated bullet.
Dummys spawn within a 25 block radius of the players character. 
If not shot, dummys will respawn within 60 seconds of the original spawntime.

Walking is restrained to the bounding box of the terrain (512x512).

General game music plays casually in the background, while lazer and gun sounds are also present when shooting.
