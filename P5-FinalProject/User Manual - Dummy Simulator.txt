Usage Guide.

Controls.

W - Forward Walking

Right Click - Shoots a cannon ball (2.0x force)

Overview.

You spawn inside a 512x512 terrain. The goal of the game is to walk arround and shoot a variety of spawning
dummys. Once shooting, the dummys will fly around. Their bodys will contor with the placement of the associated bullet.
Dummys spawn within a 25 block radius of the players character. 
If not shot, dummys will respawn within 60 seconds of the original spawntime.

Walking is restrained to the bounding box of the terrain (512x512).

General game music plays casually in the background, while lazer and gun sounds are also present when shooting.

Dicussion & Decisions.

Why was this simulator a challenge to build?

One of the toughest parts of the simulator to build was the flexibility of the dummys.
Allowing them to maintain their form as rigid bodies while also flying around the map was tough.
We ended up using a physics library to assist in the process of mainting a rigid, flexible body for the dummies.

Here are some screneshots of our test enviornment for the dummies. 
They are recieving a incomming force applied from a BoxGeometry.

Along with that, getting the gun model and texture to load into the scene was a challenge.
Aligning both to follow the camera was tough, as we wanted to have some animations for the 
movement of the gun alongside the camera.
Though, we decided to attach the gun model as a group with the camera in the end, 
allowing the gun to stay in a consistent position.

Terrain generation was something we also played around with. 
Origionlly, we used vertex shaders and displacement maps to load in a texture from a heightmap.
Though, we quickly realized that you can not raycast onto a terrain loaded in a vertex shader correctly.
We looked at soluations for this issue, but quickly realized that it would be too complicated to attempt to resolve.

The following is some images of the generated terrain.

During this process we used fragment shaders which allow for displacement of the each fragment on render to 
change the color of the terrain based on the heightmap provided. This in turn caused some issues.
Though we enjoyed the generated pattern and decided to keep it mapped to the displayed terrain.
